# hello-world
This is part of the hello world tutorial.
  
I am a beginning programmer from the USA,
my name is cadential, being a musical reference
referring to the action of cadence, a  harmonic process
signifying the end of a musical phrase.  I am
looking forward to learning about the wide
world of programming, coding, engineering and 
project management and experiencing what it 
has to offer to me and what I may offer.
